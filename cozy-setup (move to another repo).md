        ```
  well... the gateway fell over IMMEDIATELY with like 2 req/sec from deletions, with that ^^ config. for now i removed everything except the reverse proxy config + normal caddy metrics and it's running fine on vanilla caddy. i did try reducing the rate-limiting configs to a single, fixed-key global limit but it still ate all the ram and died. maybe badger w/ the cache config was still a problem. maybe it would have been ok on a machine with more than 1GB mem.


  alternative proxies:

    - nginx. i should probably just use this. acme-client is a piece of cake to set up, and i know how to configure it.
    - haproxy. also kind of familiar, it's old and stable. no idea how it handle low-mem (our 1gb) vs nginx.
    - sozu. popular rust thing, fast. doesn't have rate-limiting or cache feature?
    - rpxy. like caddy (auto-tls) but in rust and actually fast? has an "experimental" cache feature. but the cache feature looks good.
    - rama. build-your-own proxy. not sure that it has both cache and limiter in their standard features?
    - pingora. build-your-own cloudflare, so like, probably stable. has tools for cache and limiting. low-mem...?
      - cache stuff in pingora seems a little... hit and miss (byeeeee). only a test impl for Storage for the main cache feature?
      - but the rate-limiter has a guide: https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora/blob/main/docs/user_guide/rate_limiter.md

  what i want is low-resource reverse proxy with built-in rate-limiting and caching. but maybe cache (and/or ratelimiting) could be external to the reverse proxy
    - varnish is a dedicated cache. has https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules/blob/master/src/vmod_vsthrottle.vcc
    - apache traffic control has experimental rate-limiting plugins

some todos

- [x] tailscale: exit node
  - [!] link_aggregator: use exit node
    -> worked, but reverted for now: tailscale on raspi was consuming ~50% cpu for the jetstream traffic. this might be near its max since it would have been catching up at the time (max jetstream throughput) but it feels a bit too much. we have to trust the jetstream server and link_aggregator doesn't (yet) make any other external connections, so for now the raspi connects directly from my home again.
- [x] caddy: reverse proxy
  - [x] build with cache and rate-limit plugins
  - [x] configure systemd to keep it alive
- [x] configure caddy cache
- [x] configure caddy rate-limit
- [ ] configure ~caddy~ nginx to use a health check (once it's added)
- [ ] ~configure caddy to only expose cache metrics to tailnet :/~
- [x] make some grafana dashboards
- [ ] raspi: mount /dev/sda on boot
- [ ] raspi: run link_aggregator via systemd so it starts on startup (and restarts?)

- [x] use nginx instead of caddy
- [x] nginx: enable cache
- [x] nginx: rate-limit
- [ ] nginx: get metrics
